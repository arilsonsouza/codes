Random Codes
===================

This repository holds a lot of random codes that I've made using different
languages.

Between these codes you may find:

* Useful codes
* Study codes
* Hello words
* Not finished implementations

The main idea is to keep just one repository for all unfinished or test projects
instead of pollute my Github account with lots of no valuable repositories.
